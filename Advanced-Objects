!-- Advanced Objects Introduction --!

Remember, objects in JavaScript are containers that store data and functionality. In this lesson, we will build upon the fundamentals of creating objects and explore some advanced concepts.
In this lesson we will cover these topics:
1.how to use the this keyword.
2.conveying privacy in JavaScript methods
3.defining getters and setters in objects.
4.creating factory functions
5.using destructuring techniques.

! --The this Keyword --!
Objects are collections of related data and functionality. We store that functionality in methods on our objects:

const goat = {
  dietType: 'herbivore',
  makeSound() {
    console.log('baaa');
  }
};

In our goat object we have a .makeSound() method. We can invoke the .makeSound() method on goat.

goat.makeSound(); // Prints baaa

const goat = {
  dietType: 'herbivore',
  makeSound() {
    console.log('baaa');
  },
  diet() {
    console.log(dietType);
  }
};
goat.diet(); 
// Output will be "ReferenceError: dietType is not defined"

That’s strange, why is dietType not defined even though it’s a property of goat? That’s because inside the scope of the .diet() method, we don’t automatically have access to other properties of the goat object.

Here’s where the this keyword comes to the rescue. If we change the .diet() method to use the this, the .diet() works! :

const goat = {
  dietType: 'herbivore',
  makeSound() {
    console.log('baaa');
  },
  diet() {
    console.log(this.dietType);
  }
};

goat.diet(); 
// Output: herbivore

The this keyword references the calling object which provides access to the calling object’s properties. 
In the example above, the calling object is goat and by using this we’re accessing the goat object itself, and then the dietType property of goat by using property dot notation.

! -- Arrow Functions and this--!

const goat = {
  dietType: 'herbivore',
  makeSound() {
    console.log('baaa');
  },
  diet: () => {
    console.log(this.dietType);
  }
};

goat.diet(); // Prints undefined

In the comment, you can see that goat.diet() would log undefined. So what happened? Notice that the .diet() method is defined using an arrow function.

Arrow functions inherently bind, or tie, an already defined this value to the function itself that is NOT the calling object.
In the code snippet above, the value of this is the global object, or an object that exists in the global scope, which doesn’t have a dietType property and therefore returns undefined.
