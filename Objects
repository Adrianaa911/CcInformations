              !!!---Objects---!!!!

Objects can be assigned to variables just like any JavaScript type. We use curly braces, {}, to designate an object literal:

let spaceship = {}; // spaceship is an empty object

We fill an object with unordered data. This data is organized into key-value pairs. A key is like a variable name that points to a location in memory that holds a value.
A key’s value can be of any data type in the language including functions or other objects.
We make a key-value pair by writing the key’s name, or identifier, followed by a colon and then the value. We separate each key-value pair in an object literal with a comma (,).
Keys are strings, but when we have a key that does not have any special characters in it, JavaScript allows us to omit the quotation marks:


// An object literal with two key-value pairs
let spaceship = {
  'Fuel Type': 'diesel',
  color: 'silver'
};

The spaceship object has two properties Fuel Type and color. 'Fuel Type' has quotation marks because it contains a space character.

   -- Accessing Properties -- !!

There are two ways we can access an object’s property. Let’s explore the first way— dot notation, ..
You’ve used dot notation to access the properties and methods of built-in objects and data instances:

'hello'.length; // Returns 5

With property dot notation, we write the object’s name, followed by the dot operator and then the property name (key):

let spaceship = {
  homePlanet: 'Earth',
  color: 'silver'
};
spaceship.homePlanet; // Returns 'Earth',
spaceship.color; // Returns 'silver',


If we try to access a property that does not exist on that object, undefined will be returned.
spaceship.favoriteIcecream; // Returns undefined

Tasks:

let spaceship = {
  homePlanet: 'Earth',
  color: 'silver',
  'Fuel Type': 'Turbo Fuel',
  numCrew: 5,
  flightPath: ['Venus', 'Mars', 'Saturn']
};

1.Let’s use the dot operator to access the value of numCrew from the spaceship object in the code editor. 

let crewCount = spaceship.numCrew;
Create a variable crewCount and assign the spaceship‘s numCrew property to it.

2. Again using the dot operator, create a variable planetArray and assign the spaceship‘s flightPath property to it.

let planetArray = spaceship.flightPath;

   --- Bracket Notation --- !!

The second way to access a key’s value is by using bracket notation, [ ].
You’ve used bracket notation when indexing an array:

['A', 'B', 'C'][0]; // Returns 'A'

To use bracket notation to access an object’s property, we pass in the property name (key) as a string.
We must use bracket notation when accessing keys that have numbers, spaces, or special characters in them. Without bracket notation in these situations, our code would throw an error.

let spaceship = {
  'Fuel Type': 'Turbo Fuel',
  'Active Duty': true,
  homePlanet: 'Earth',
  numCrew: 5
};
spaceship['Active Duty'];   // Returns true
spaceship['Fuel Type'];   // Returns  'Turbo Fuel'
spaceship['numCrew'];   // Returns 5
spaceship['!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'];   // Returns undefined

With bracket notation you can also use a variable inside the brackets to select the keys of an object. This can be especially helpful when working with functions:

let returnAnyProp = (objectName, propName) => objectName[propName]; 
returnAnyProp(spaceship, 'homePlanet'); // Returns 'Earth'

tasks:

let spaceship = {
  'Fuel Type' : 'Turbo Fuel',
  'Active Mission' : true,
  homePlanet : 'Earth', 
  numCrew: 5
 };

let propName =  'Active Mission';

1. Let’s use bracket notation to access the value of 'Active Mission' from the spaceship object in the code editor. Create a variable isActive and assign the spaceship‘s 'Active Mission' property to it.
If we tried to write our returnAnyProp() function with dot notation (objectName.propName) the computer would look for a key of 'propName' on our object and not the value of the propName parameter.

2. Using bracket notation and the propName variable provided, console.log() the value of the 'Active Mission' property.

console.log(spaceship[propName]);


!! -- Property Assignment -- !

Once we’ve defined an object, we’re not stuck with all the properties we wrote. 
Objects are mutable meaning we can update them after we create them!

We can use either dot notation, ., or bracket notation, [], and the assignment operator, = to add new key-value pairs to an object or change an existing property.

diagram showing how an object followed by brackets ([]) with the property name as a string can be reassigned to a new value. 
This same idea applies for accessing a property using dot notation which has the object name, followed by a dot and the name of the property
One of two things can happen with property assignment:
If the property already exists on the object, whatever value it held before will be replaced with the newly assigned value.
If there was no property with that name, a new property will be added to the object.
It’s important to know that although we can’t reassign an object declared with const, we can still mutate it, meaning we can add new properties and change the properties that are there.

const spaceship = {type: 'shuttle'};
spaceship = {type: 'alien'}; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
spaceship.type = 'alien'; // Changes the value of the type property
spaceship.speed = 'Mach 5'; // Creates a new key of 'speed' with a value of 'Mach 5'

You can delete a property from an object with the delete operator.

const spaceship = {
  'Fuel Type': 'Turbo Fuel',
  homePlanet: 'Earth',
  mission: 'Explore the universe' 
};
 
delete spaceship.mission;  // Removes the mission property

let isActive = spaceship['Active Mission'];

Tasks:

let spaceship = {
  'Fuel Type' : 'Turbo Fuel',
  homePlanet : 'Earth',
  color: 'silver',
  'Secret Mission' : 'Discover life outside of Earth.'
};

1.Reassign the color property of the spaceship object to have a value of 'glorious gold'

spaceship.color = 'glorious gold';
